# Multi-Disease Prediction for Shrimp Aquaculture

## Simulated Data Generation

This project has been expanded to include multiple shrimp diseases beyond just WSSV. The `generate_simulated_data.py` script can generate realistic simulated data for the following diseases:

1. **White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV)**
2. **Early Mortality Syndrome (EMS)/Acute Hepatopancreatic Necrosis Disease (AHPND)**
3. **Infectious Hypodermal and Hematopoietic Necrosis Virus (IHHNV)**
4. **Yellow Head Virus (YHV)**
5. **Infectious Myonecrosis Virus (IMNV)**

### How to Generate Simulated Data

1. Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed with the following packages:
   - pandas
   - numpy

2. Run the script:
   ```
   python generate_simulated_data.py
   ```

3. The script will generate:
   - Individual CSV files for each disease in `data/simulated/`
   - A combined dataset with all diseases in `data/simulated/simulated_combined_diseases_data.csv`
   - A copy of the WSSV data in `data/raw/sample_wssv_data.csv` for compatibility with the existing app

### Data Generation Process

The script uses domain knowledge about each disease to generate realistic data points:

1. Creates random but realistic environmental parameters (temperature, salinity, pH, etc.)
2. Applies disease-specific rules to calculate outbreak probabilities
3. Adds realistic noise to make the data more authentic
4. Clearly marks all data as simulated with a "data_source" column

### Data Volume

The script generates approximately 1,800 data points across all diseases:
- WSSV: 500 records
- EMS/AHPND: 400 records
- IHHNV: 350 records
- YHV: 300 records
- IMNV: 250 records

### Extending the App

To extend the app to support multiple diseases:

1. Modify the UI to include a disease selection dropdown
2. Train separate models for each disease using the simulated data
3. Update the prediction logic to use the appropriate model based on the selected disease

### Disclaimer

All data generated by this script is simulated based on general knowledge about these diseases. While it attempts to model realistic relationships between environmental factors and disease outbreaks, it should not be used for actual farm management decisions without validation against real-world data.

## Portfolio Project

This project is intended as a portfolio piece to demonstrate:
- Machine learning application in aquaculture
- Multi-disease prediction capabilities
- Domain knowledge of shrimp diseases
- Data generation for ML training

For real-world applications, the system would need to be trained on actual farm data.
